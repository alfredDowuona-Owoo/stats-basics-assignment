Using the wrong statistical method can lead to incorrect or misleading results. For example, you can't calculate the mean or perform meaningful addition and subtraction on ordinal data.\n",
    "    - Data Interpretation: The level of measurement informs how you interpret the data. Knowing the level helps you understand the nature of relationships between variables and make valid comparisons. For instance, comparing the mean incomes of two groups is more meaningful with ratio-level income data than with ordinal-level income categories.\n",
    "    - Data Visualization: Proper data visualization is essential for conveying information effectively. Choosing the right type of graph or chart depends on the level of measurement. For example, nominal data might be best represented using bar charts, while interval or ratio data can be visualized using histograms or scatterplots.\n",
